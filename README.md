# transformer_framework
Simple try in transformer by making a basic framework.

# The making lists
1. Design the position encoder(sinusoidal), the position wise feed forward network and the attention mask(encoder, decoder, encoder-decoder)
2. Complete the multiple head attention block
3. Finish the class design of encoder and decoder
4. Encapsulate the part above into a transformer
5. Start the code with the main function
