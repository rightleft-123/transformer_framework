# transformer_framework
Simple try in transformer by making a basic framework(not project specific)

# The making lists
1. Design the `position encoder`(sinusoidal), the `position wise feed forward network` and the `attention mask`(encoder, decoder, encoder-decoder mask)
2. Complete the `multiple head attention` block
3. Finish the entire design of `encoder` and `decoder`
4. Encapsulate the part above into a `transformer`
5. Start the code with the `main` function
